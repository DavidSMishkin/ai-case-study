## Overview and Origin

* Name of Company: Tesla, Inc.
* Company Incorporation: Tesla, Inc. was founded in 2003 in San Carlos, CA
* Founders: The company was founded in 2003 by two Silicon Valley engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who wanted to prove that "electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars.”
  
* Idea Origin:  
The founders were influenced to start the company after General Motors recalled all its EV1 electric cars in 2003 and then destroyed them, and seeing the higher fuel efficiency of battery-electric cars as an opportunity to break the usual correlation between high performance and low fuel economy in automobiles. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla who invented the Induction motor used in Tesla automobiles.  Eberhard said that he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor". In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the company's largest shareholder. He became CEO in 2008. Tesla's announced mission is to create products which help "accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy."

* Funding and Growth:  
Funding for the company was obtained from a variety of sources, most notably PayPal cofounder Elon Musk, who contributed more than $30 million to the new venture and served as chairman of the company, beginning in 2004. In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team.[22][17] Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll.[23] A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million.[23]
