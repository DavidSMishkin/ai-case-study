AI Case Study  
Module 1 Challenge - by David Mishkin

## Overview and Origin:

* **Name of Company:** Tesla, Inc. (also known as Tesla Motors) 
* **Company Incorporation:** Tesla, Inc. was founded in 2003 in San Carlos, CA  
* **Founders:** The company was founded by two Silicon Valley engineers **Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning** who wanted to prove that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars.
  
* **Idea Origin:**
    
The founders were influenced to start the company after General Motors recalled all its EV1 electric cars in 2003 and then destroyed them, and seeing the higher fuel efficiency of battery-electric cars as an opportunity to break the usual correlation between high performance and low fuel economy in automobiles. The company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical engineer **Nikola Tesla** who invented the **Induction motor** used in Tesla automobiles.  Eberhard said that he wanted to build **"a car manufacturer that is also a technology company"**, with its core technologies including the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor. In February 2004, via a $6.5 million investment, Elon Musk became the company's largest shareholder. He became CEO in 2008. Tesla's announced mission is to create products which help "accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy."

* **Funding and Growth:**
   
Inital Funding for the company was obtained from a variety of sources, most notably PayPal cofounder **Elon Musk**, who contributed more than $30 million to the new venture and served as chairman of the company, beginning in 2004. In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B venture capital funding round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team. Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and former eBay President Jeff Skoll. A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million. In  2008 Musk took over as CEO. In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the $8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology. In 2010 Tesla’s provided an initial public offering which raised some $226 million. In May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California, from Toyota for $42 million, and opened the facility in October 2010 to start production of the Model S. **On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ**, the first American car company to do so since the Ford Motor Company had its IPO in 1956. The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million. 

In January 2012, Tesla introduced the Model S luxury sedan. The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year,and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013. The Model S was also the bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016. Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called "hardware version 1". Tesla began building large factories it called Gigafactories to produce batteries and vehicles. The first such factory opened in 2016 outside Reno, Nevada. Gigafactories were opened in Buffalo, New York, and Shanghai, China, and more Gigafactories were planned. By the end of 2018, the Model 3 would become the world's bestselling electric car from 2018 to 2021.

From July 2019 to June 2020, **Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500**. Tesla was added to the index on December 21, 2020. It was the most valuable company ever added, already the sixth-largest member. During 2020, the share price increased 740%, and on January 26, 2021, its market capitalization reached $848 billion, more than the next nine largest automakers combined and becoming the US' 5th most valuable company.

## Business Activities:

* **Problem Addressed:**

Tesla, Inc views itself and its automobile offerings as a **"Technology Company"** rather than a simple automobile manufacturer. Its significant **AI contribution was the self-driving autonomous software** that provides customers with a new paradigm for driving without manual operation. Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety and convenience behind the wheel and efficiency. When used properly, Autopilot reduces your overall workload as a driver. Each new Tesla vehicle is equipped with multiple external cameras and powerful vision processing to provide an additional layer of safety. 

* **Target Customer:**

Tesla's targeting segmentation approach includes behavioral and psychographic segmentation. It is aimed at dedicated and aspiring **middle and upper-class customer**s who want and are looking for prestige, the appearance of being **environmentally friendly**, and the long-term cost-effectiveness of automobiles. . Because Tesla Inc.'s strategic goal is to capture the mass market, the major target markets should be sectors with characteristics that are comparable to those of mass markets. 

Other consumer groups inside their target market acted and valued things differently from the group above, according to their marketing segmentation and targeting technique. They were dubbed **"fad users"** since they would quickly follow a trendy trend or connect with stardom. Tesla, Inc. has stated business plans to develop and introduce budget vehicles, which will be far less expensive and smaller than prior models. 

* **Unique Solution and Technology**

Tesla's competitive advantage stems from its ability to employ current **Electric Vehicle (EV)** technologies more efficiently than competitors. Tesla has designed battery systems and electric vehicles with the highest technological advancements. It has advanced technology to cool and heat their batteries which greatly extends battery life. These technological advances are resonating with consumers, Tesla's market share has grown and they have become the largest manufacturer of electric vehicles. Recent car price cuts are improving affordability, and demand is very high over their competitors.

Tesla also has two main advantages compared to competitors. **They have the infrastructure for autonomous cars in place and they have their data operations in place.** This gives Tesla automobiles an advantage in AI-competitions. It’s not only about having the technology. It’s even more important to have the strategic position to utilize the technology and that’s exactly what Tesla has done right. 

Tesla has been building their infrastructure by making **all their cars ready to drive autonomously, simply by sending out a software update.** They have hit the ground running while all other manufactures are still "tying their shoelaces". Tesla can quickly get market share that sticks and can get valuable learning and insights before anyone else. They also have manufacturing in place and have been practising making almost the complete product for years. This will make it way cheaper for Tesla to produce the cars that any other car maker can do. They also have the right **data operations**. Tesla collects large amounts of data at a very low cost. Having low cost, high quality data operations are the true competitive advantage of AI.

Tesla’s has also developed a network of **Supercharger stations** which provide a fast charging experience, with charging times as low as 45 minutes. Their stations are strategically located along highways and major routes, making long-distance travel easy and convenient for Tesla owners. In addition to the Supercharger network, Tesla also offers Destination Charging at hotels, restaurants, and other locations, providing additional convenience for their customers.

This figure – 10 million EV sales worldwide – exceeds the total number of cars sold across the entire European Union (about 9.5 million vehicles) and is nearly half of the total number of cars sold in China in 2022. In the course of just five years, from 2017 to 2022, EV sales jumped from around 1 million to more than 10 million. It previously took five years from 2012 to 2017 for EV sales to grow from 100,000 to 1 million, underscoring the exponential nature of EV sales growth. The share of electric cars in total car sales jumped from 9% in 2021 to 14% in 2022, more than 10 times their share in 2017.

* **Major Competitors in in this Field:**

Tesla's competitors include Ford and General Motors. Other Industry leaders include Nio, Nissan, Toyota, Audi, BMW and Rivian. 

## Results of Tesla, Inc.

* **Business Impact:**

Tesla has made significant contributions in the autonomous driving systems market for Automobile applications. The company's advancements in Lithium-ion battery technology, charging infrastructure and artificial intelligence based driving algorithms have been important in improving automated and resource efficient driving capabilities, particularly against competitors in the electric vehicle marketplace.

* **Core Metrics of Success**
  
The market for electric vehicles measures success based on 3 core metrics: availability, reliability, and convenience.

**Availability:** is measured by a consumers "range anxiety" which is a critical factor for people who consider buying an EV. This means that every 50-60 miles, there must be a publicly accessible charging station available.

**Reliability:** The second aspect consumers value when it comes to EV charging is the reliability of the charging infrastructure. As one can imagine, nothing is more frustrating than a charger being out-of-order while you have a nearly empty battery. This only exacerbates the whole range anxiety issue. Reliable charging services lead to improved customer experience and increased customer loyalty, higher charging and upsell revenues, and have a positive impact on brand perception.

**Convenience:** People can spend 20-30 minutes charging their electric cars, and they like having the option to spend their time in a productive way while waiting for their charge to complete. This will also benefit retailers who provide shopping and dining services to EV owners which could provide additional revenue for such services.

Tesla's business model successfully incorporates all 3 of these metrics as the company has made critical investments in vast charging station infrastructure and long range power output of its Lithium-ion batteries. Tesla's charging stations are often located with convenience store and restaurant or retail establishments. Other EV companies have begun to use Teslas enormous charging infrastructure to recharge their automobiles as they have not developed their own charging infrastructure. This benefits Tesla who is first to the market with EV charging infrastructure which provides a larger income stream than just selling autos alone.
